# bamazon

Bamazon is an app that allows you to purchase various items. Upon loading the app, Bamazon will display all of the items for sale and ask what is the item the user wants to purchase. The user will enter the item they want to purchase then the user will be asked how many of the item the user wishes to purchase. If there is enough of the item to fill the user's order, the purchase will be made and the SQL database will be updated with the new stock quantity. If there is not enough to fill the user's order, a message will be displayed stating that there is insufficient quantity. 

After installing the necessary modules, the user will type "node Bamazon.js" into the terminal to start the app.
